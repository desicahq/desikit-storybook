# Welcome to Desikit
This is the Desica design system, located at [desicahq/desikit-storybook](https://github.com/desicahq/desikit-storybook) on Github.

### Getting started
To get started, clone the getting started repo by running `git clone https://github.com/desicahq/starter --bare`, which will give you a nextjs project complete with the tailwind and postcss config files you'll need to get started. Be sure to check here regularly, as we will be publishing regular updates.
